## Experiment 8: Shell Programming

### Name: Gayatri Bhatt   Roll No.: 590023785   Date: 2025-09-23

### Aim:

* To extend shell programming concepts by using conditional statements, advanced scripting constructs, and command-line arguments.
* To practice writing scripts that perform decision-making and parameter handling.

### Requirements

* A Linux system with bash shell.
* Text editor and permission to create/execute shell scripts.

## Theory

Conditional execution in shell scripts allows branching logic using `if`, `elif`, `else`, and `case` statements. Scripts can accept command-line arguments using `$1`, `$2`, … and `$@` for all arguments. Control flow constructs combined with user input and arguments allow dynamic and reusable scripts.

## Procedure & Observations

## Exercise 1: Using `if-else`

### Task Statement:

Write a script to check whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero.

### Explanation:

We used an `if-elif-else` construct to compare the number against 0.

### Command(s):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
num=$1
if [ $num -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "$num is positive"
elif [ $num -lt 0 ]; then
  echo "$num is negative"
else
  echo "$num is zero"
fi
```

## Exercise 2: Using `case`

### Task Statement:

Write a script that takes a character as input and classifies it as vowel, consonant, digit, or special character.

### Explanation:

The `case` statement provides pattern matching for multiple options.

### Command(s):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
ch=$1
case $ch in
  [aeiouAEIOU]) echo "$ch is a vowel" ;;
  [bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ]) echo "$ch is a consonant" ;;
  [0-9]) echo "$ch is a digit" ;;
  *) echo "$ch is a special character" ;;
esac
```

## Exercise 3: Command-line arguments

### Task Statement:

Write a script that accepts filename(s) as arguments and prints the number of lines in each file.

### Explanation:

Command-line arguments are accessed using `$@`. Looping through each argument allows file-wise operations.

### Command(s):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for file in "$@"; do
  if [ -f "$file" ]; then
    echo "$file: $(wc -l < "$file") lines"
  else
    echo "$file not found"
  fi
done
```

## Exercise 4: Nested conditionals

### Task Statement:

Write a script to check if a year is a leap year.

### Explanation:

A leap year is divisible by 4, but if divisible by 100 it must also be divisible by 400.

### Command(s):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
year=$1
if (( year % 400 == 0 )); then
  echo "$year is a leap year"
elif (( year % 100 == 0 )); then
  echo "$year is not a leap year"
elif (( year % 4 == 0 )); then
  echo "$year is a leap year"
else
  echo "$year is not a leap year"
fi
```

## Task 1

### Task Statement:

Write a script that starts a background job (e.g., `sleep 60`), lists all jobs, brings the job to the foreground, and then terminates it.

### Command(s):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

sleep 60 &
jobs
fg %1
kill %1
```

## Task 2

### Task Statement:

Create a script that compares two files and displays whether their contents are identical or different.

### Command(s):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enterfile 1: " file1
read -p "Enterfile 2: " file2

if cmp -s "$file1" "$file2"; then
    echo "Files are identical."
else
    echo "Files are different."
fi
```

### Output:

## Task 3

### Task Statement:

Write a script that counts the number of processes currently being run by your user.

### Command(s):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Number of processes for user $USER:"
ps -u $USER | wc -l
```

### Output:

## Task 4

### Task Statement:

Develop a script that monitors memory usage every 5 seconds and logs it into a file.

### Command(s):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

while true; do
    echo "Mem use  $(date)" >> memory_log.txt
    free -m >> memory_log.txt
    echo "--------------------------" >> memory_log.txt
    sleep 5
done
```

### Output:

## Task 5

### Task Statement:

Write a script that prompts for a filename and a search pattern, then displays the count of matching lines.

### Command(s):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter fname: " file
read -p "Enter search pattern: " pattern

count=$(grep -c "$pattern" "$file")
echo "Number of matching lines: $count"
```

### Output:

## Result

* Implemented conditional statements (`if-else`, `case`) in shell scripts.
* Practiced handling command-line arguments and nested conditions.
* Wrote reusable and flexible shell scripts.

## Challenges Faced & Learning Outcomes

* Challenge 1: Forgetting to quote variables in conditions — resolved by using `"$var"` to avoid word splitting.
* Challenge 2: Pattern matching in `case` — practiced with multiple examples.

### Learning:

* Learned practical use of branching and decision-making in shell scripting.
* Understood command-line argument handling for automation.

## Conclusion

This experiment extended shell programming by introducing decision-making and parameter handling. The scripts demonstrate the flexibility of shell programming for different use cases.

## Experiment 2: Linux File Systems, Permissions, and Essential Commands

### Name:Gayatri Bhatt   Roll No.: 590023785   Date: 2025-09-23

### Aim: 

* To understand Linux file system structure, file permissions, and basic essential commands.
* To learn how to manipulate file access permissions using commands like `ls`, `chmod`, and `umask`.

### Requirements

* A Linux machine (Ubuntu, Fedora, or similar) with bash shell.
* Basic user privileges to create, modify, and delete files.

## Theory

Linux organizes files into a hierarchical directory structure starting from the root `/`. Every file and directory has associated permissions that define who can read, write, or execute them. Permissions are categorized for the **owner**, **group**, and **others**. Essential commands like `ls`, `pwd`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `chmod`, and `umask` allow navigation and permission management within the file system.

## Procedure & Observations

## Exercise 1: Explore Linux File System

### Task Statement:

Navigate through the Linux file system and list important directories such as `/bin`, `/etc`, `/home`, `/var`, `/tmp` and understand their purpose.

### Explanation:

I used the `ls` command to explore the root directory and subdirectories. Each directory has a special purpose, such as `/bin` for binaries, `/etc` for configuration files, `/home` for user data, `/var` for logs, and `/tmp` for temporary files.

### Command(s):

```bash
ls /
ls /bin
ls /etc
ls /home
ls /var
ls /tmp
```

## Exercise 2: Understanding File Permissions

### Task Statement:

Check and understand the permissions of files using `ls -l` command.

### Explanation:

The `ls -l` command shows file details including permissions, owner, group, size, and modification date. Permissions are represented in 10 characters: the first indicates file type, and the next nine represent read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions for owner, group, and others.

### Command(s):

```bash
ls -l
```

### Output:

<img align="center" src="img/2exp2.png" width="900">
</p>

## Exercise 3: Changing Permissions with `chmod`

### Task Statement:

Use the `chmod` command to change file permissions.

### Explanation:

The `chmod` command modifies file permissions either symbolically (e.g., `u+x`) or numerically (e.g., `755`). For example, `chmod 755 file1` grants read, write, and execute to the owner, and read and execute to group and others.

### Command(s):

```bash
chmod 755 file1
ls -l file1
chmod u-w file1
ls -l file1
```

### Output:

<p align="center">

</p>

## Exercise 4: Default Permissions with `umask`

### Task Statement:

Understand the concept of default permissions using the `umask` command.

### Explanation:

The `umask` value determines the default permission bits removed when a new file or directory is created. For example, a `umask` of `022` results in files with `644` permissions and directories with `755` permissions.

### Command(s):

```bash
umask
umask 022
touch newfile
ls -l newfile
```

### Output:

## Result

* The Linux file system hierarchy was explored successfully.
* File permissions were checked, modified, and understood using `ls -l`, `chmod`, and `umask`.
* The experiment helped in learning how Linux controls access to files and directories.

## Challenges Faced & Learning Outcomes

* Challenge 1: Remembering symbolic vs numeric modes in `chmod`. Fixed by practicing with examples.
* Challenge 2: Understanding the `umask` calculation. Overcame by revising the subtraction method.

### Learning:

* Learned how to navigate Linux file systems.
* Understood file permissions and their significance.
* Learned how to use `chmod` and `umask` effectively.

## Conclusion

The experiment demonstrated Linux file system organization, permissions, and essential commands. It highlighted the importance of access control and provided hands-on experience in managing file permissions, which is a key skill for Linux system administration.

## TASK 1: [Directory Navigation]

## Task Statement:
* [Create a directory called test_project in your home directory, then create subdirectories docs, scripts, and data inside it. Navigate to the scripts directory and display your current path.]

## Explanation:
* [ Use mkdir to create the wanted directory we can use cd to navigate and use pwd to show current path ]

## Command(s):
''' 
mkdir test_project
cd test_project 
mkdir docs scripts data
cd scripts 
pwd
'''

## TASK 2: [FIle Creation and Content]

## Task Statement:
* [Create three files in the docs directory: readme.txt, notes.txt, and todo.txt. Add the text "Project documentation" to readme.txt and "Important notes" to notes.txt. Display the contents of both files.]

## Explanation:
* [We can use touch to create empty files and using echo "text" > file.txt to add content to a file and using cat to display file contents]

## Command(s):
```
cd docs 
touch readme.txt notes.txt todo.txt 
echo "Project documentation" > readme.txt
echo "Important notes" > notes.txt
cat notes.txt
cat readme.txt

```

## TASK 3: [FIle Operations]

## Task Statement:
* [Copy readme.txt to the data directory and rename the copy to project_info.txt. Then move todo.txt from docs to scripts directory.]

## Explanation:
* [- We can use the cp source destination to copy files and using the mv oldname newname to rename files also using the same command mv file directory/ to move files to another directory we can also combine copy and rename: cp file.txt newdir/newname.txt]


## Command(s):
```
cp readme.txt data/project_info.txt

```

### Output:

## TASK 4: [FIle Permissions]

## Task Statement:
* [Create a shell script file called backup.sh in the scripts directory. Add the content #!/bin/bash and echo "Backup complete" to it. Make the file executable only for the owner.]

## Explanation:
* [Using chmod u+x filename we can make the file executable for user only using ls -l to check for permissions also script files typically need executable permission to run]

## Command(s):
```
cd scripts 
touch backup.sh > echo "Backup complete"
chmod u+x backup.sh

```

### Output:

## TASK 5: [FIle Viewing]

## Task Statement:
* [Create a file called numbers.txt with numbers 1 to 20 (each on a new line). Display only the first 5 lines, then only the last 3 lines, then search for lines containing the number "1".]

## Explanation:
*  [ I can quickly generate a list of numbers by running seq 1 20 > numbers.txt. To check the first few numbers, I use head -n 5 to see the first 5 lines, and tail -n 3 to see the last 3 lines. If I want to find all numbers containing a “1”, I can use grep "1". Alternatively, I could create the list manually by using multiple echo commands.]

## Command(s):
```
seq 1 20 > numbers.txt
head -n 5
tail -n 3
grep "1"

```

## TASK 6: [Text Editing]

## Task Statement:
* [Using nano, create a file called config.txt with the following content:

Database=localhost Port=5432 Username=admin <pre></pre> Save the file and then display its contents.]

## Explanation:
* [I open a file in Nano using nano filename.txt and type my content normally. Once I’m done, I press Ctrl+O to save the file and Ctrl+X to exit Nano. After that, I use cat to check the contents and make sure everything was saved correctly.]

## Command(s):
```
vim config.txt
cat config.txt

```
#### Alternatively 

```
nano config.txt
cat config.txt

```

## TASK 7: [System Information]

## Task Statement:
* [Create a file called system_info.txt that contains: your username, current date, your current directory, and disk usage information in human-readable format.
]

## Explanation:
* [I can use whoami to check my username, date to see the current date, and pwd to know my current directory. To check disk usage, I use df -h. I can save the output of any command to a file by using redirection like command >> filename.txt. If I want to add labels, I use echo like this: echo "Username:" >> file.txt.]

## Command(s):
```
cd scripts
touch system_info.txt
echo "Username:" >> system_info.txt
whoami >> system_info.txt
echo "Date:" >> system_info.txt
date >> system_info.txt
echo "Current Directory:" >> system_info.txt
pwd >> system_info.txt
echo "Disk Usage:" >> system_info.txt
df -h >> system_info.txt

```

## TASK 8: [File Organisation]

## Task Statement:
* [In your test_project directory, create a backup folder. Copy all .txt files from all subdirectories into this backup folder. Then list all files in the backup folder with detailed information.
]

## Explanation:
* [I can use find . -name "*.txt" to locate all .txt files. Alternatively, I can navigate to each directory and copy files manually. To copy multiple files at once, I use cp file1.txt file2.txt destination/. If I want detailed information about the files, I use ls -la. The wildcard *.txt helps me match all files that end with .txt.]

## Command(s):
```
cp test_project/data/project_info.txt    test_project/docs/notes.txt    test_project/docs/readme.txt    test_project/docs/todo.txt    test_project/scripts/config.txt    test_project/scripts/numbers.txt    test_project/scripts/system_info.txt    test_project/scripts/todo.txt    backup/

```

## TASK 9: [Process and History]

## Task Statement:
* [Display your command history and count how many commands you've executed. Then show the top 10 most recent commands.
]

## Explanation:
* [I can use history to see all the commands I’ve typed. To count the total number of commands, I use history | wc -l. If I want to view just the last 10 commands, I can use history 10 or history | tail -10. The wc -l command simply counts the number of lines in the output.]

## Command(s):
```
history 10
```

## TASK 10: [Comprehensive Cleanup]

## Task Statement:
* [Set the permissions of your backup.sh script to be readable, writable, and executable by owner, readable and executable by group, and readable by others. Then create a summary file that lists the total number of files and directories in your entire test_project.]

## Explanation:
* [I can set permissions for backup.sh using chmod 754 backup.sh to give rwxr-xr-- permissions. Alternatively, I can use chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=r backup.sh. To count all files, I use find . -type f | wc -l, and to count directories, I use find . -type d | wc -l. If I want to see the full directory structure recursively, I use ls -R. I can also combine multiple commands with && or save the outputs to a summary file for later reference.]

## Command(s):
```
chmod 754 backup.sh


echo "Total files:" > summary.txt
find . -type f | wc -l >> summary.txt
echo "Total directories:" >> summary.txt
find . -type d | wc -l >> summary.txt


```
